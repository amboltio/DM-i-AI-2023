# AI Text Detector

In this use case, you will be receiving 1956 text strings of varying length. Your task is to predict whether or not the text is generated by an AI. See the image below for an illustration of the concept.

</p>

You will receive the 1956 strings as a list of strings. You should return a list of integers in {0, 1} corresponding to a prediction of whether or not the text was generated by an AI.

## Evaluation

During the week of competition, you will be able to validate your solution against a validation set. The best score your model achieves on the validation set will be displayed on the scoreboard.

Your model will be evaluated by accuracy. 

Notice that you can only submit once! We encourage you to validate your code and API before you submit your final model. You can find the documentation of your API where you can try out your model and verify the prediction. The documentation is by default found at `0.0.0.0:4242/docs`, and then find the prediction endpoint for the use case.

After evaluation, your final score will be provided. This score can be seen on the scoreboard shortly after.
